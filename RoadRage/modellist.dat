Desciption of this file format :


COMMANDS :


PLAYER   used to add new male/female/robot characters to the game

CAR		 used to add new cars/tanks/motorbikes etc

YOURGUN	 used to add new weapons for the player's own view (the one's 
         you see with just a couple of arms attached to the weapon).

OPGUN    used to add new weapons for your opponents/enemies guns 
         (the weapon model you see an opponent carrying)

DEBUG    This command will place a model anywhere on the map, and will 
         ignore any gameplay rules that apply to that type of model.
		 Also you can test out the models aninimation sequences by 
		 pressing keys 0 to 9.



ADDING A NEW MODEL :  

Example:

If you only have one car defined like this :

CAR			0 MD2 MODEL_ID 1 models\cars\jeep.md2			TEX 30  POS 700 0 502  ANGLE 250	SCALE 0.4


just copy the last car line, and paste it underneath like this :

CAR			0 MD2 MODEL_ID 1 models\cars\jeep.md2			TEX 30  POS 700 0 502  ANGLE 250	SCALE 0.4
CAR			0 MD2 MODEL_ID 1 models\cars\jeep.md2			TEX 30  POS 700 0 502  ANGLE 250	SCALE 0.4

Now you need to make a few changes to the numbers and filenames

change the 0 to 1 (note every car must have a different car number like this :

CAR			0 MD2 MODEL_ID 1 models\cars\jeep.md2			TEX 30  POS 700 0 502  ANGLE 250	SCALE 0.4
CAR			1 MD2 MODEL_ID 1 models\cars\jeep.md2			TEX 30  POS 700 0 502  ANGLE 250	SCALE 0.4

If the car is an MD2 then leave the second parameter the way it is. 
If you want to add a 3DS model then change it to "3DS" instead of "MD2", with out the quote marks.

Next change the number after "MODEL_ID" to next next available model id. 
So if your modellist.dat file looks like this :


PLAYER		0 MD2 MODEL_ID 0 models\players\male\male.md2   TEX 24  POS 900 0 458  ANGLE 190	SCALE 0.4  USE_EXTERNAL_WEP
CAR			0 MD2 MODEL_ID 1 models\cars\jeep.md2			TEX 30  POS 700 0 502  ANGLE 250	SCALE 0.4
YOURGUN		0 MD2 MODEL_ID 2 models\weapons\m4.md2			TEX 25  POS 0 0 0	   ANGLE 0		SCALE 0.4
YOURGUN		1 MD2 MODEL_ID 3 models\weapons\mp5.md2			TEX 26  POS 0 0 0	   ANGLE 0		SCALE 0.4
YOURGUN		2 MD2 MODEL_ID 4 models\weapons\flamer.md2		TEX 27  POS -5 -2 -5   ANGLE 0		SCALE 0.4
OPGUN		0 MD2 MODEL_ID 5 models\weapons\wm4.md2			TEX 28  SCALE 0.4
OPGUN		1 MD2 MODEL_ID 6 models\weapons\wmp5.md2		TEX 29  SCALE 0.4
OPGUN		2 MD2 MODEL_ID 7 models\weapons\wmp5.md2		TEX 27  SCALE 0.4
DEBUG		0 MD2 MODEL_ID 8 models\cars\neobike.md2		TEX 37  POS 800 0 500  ANGLE 0		SCALE 0.4
DEBUG		1 MD2 MODEL_ID 9 models\cars\jeep.md2			TEX 30  POS 700 0 500  ANGLE 0		SCALE 0.5
DEBUG		2 MD2 MODEL_ID 10 models\aircraft\heli.md2		TEX 31  POS 660 3 800  ANGLE 0		SCALE 0.5


11 would be the available model id. So you should have this in the cars bit :

CAR			0 MD2 MODEL_ID 1  models\cars\jeep.md2			TEX 30  POS 700 0 502  ANGLE 250	SCALE 0.4
CAR			1 MD2 MODEL_ID 11 models\cars\jeep.md2			TEX 30  POS 700 0 502  ANGLE 250	SCALE 0.4


Now change the model name and file path ot it:
If you wanted to add the Neobike for example, this is what you'd have

CAR			0 MD2 MODEL_ID 1  models\cars\jeep.md2			TEX 30  POS 700 0 502  ANGLE 250	SCALE 0.4
CAR			1 MD2 MODEL_ID 11 models\cars\neobike.md2		TEX 30  POS 700 0 502  ANGLE 250	SCALE 0.4


Now change the number after "TEX", which is your texture number as defined in the "textures.dat" file
If you not quite sure about this try leaving the number as it is and see what happens, then changing it 
to something else, like the number of a player skin etc.

After adding a new texture to "textures.dat" you may end up with this

CAR			1 MD2 MODEL_ID 11 models\cars\neobike.md2		TEX 37  POS 700 0 502  ANGLE 250	SCALE 0.4


37 maybe the texture number of the last texture you added ie the neobike skin

Try altering the numbers after POS, SCALE by small amounts and see what happens, 
and add or subtract 90 from ANGLE and see what happens when you run RR.


NOTES :

model ID's must be unique

ANGLE must be a whole and positive numver between 0 and 360

To use a new texture you must first add it to the "textures.dat" file

Every model can have it's own different scale. The smaller the scale the smaller the model will appear

Models added with the DEBUG command will not obey game play rules set by RR, they are so you can place
any model into the map without the need to change the RR code, or use the RR map editor. Also you can 
test out your new models animation sequences and see what they look like in game, with a minimum of effort.

Every Model added with the DEBUG command must have a ".seq" file which contains info on what frames are 
to be played back for a given animation sequence.
